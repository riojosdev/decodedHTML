# Power of Rust in the palm of my Discord Server
Let me awkwardly explain. The power of Rust, in the palm of my hand. Well my hand is interacting with the discord application on my device. And I am really trying to leverage the power of Rust, via Discord. So my beginning statement is still true. ðŸ¥‚

## Serenity is a Rust library for the Discord API
I just started exploring what all I am able to do with it. This is my adventure to find what it's limits are? 

There are examples on the [Serenity repository on Github](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity). Which shows simple tasks that can be done. Also there is the [rust doc generated for the Serenity crate](https://docs.rs/serenity/0.11.5/serenity/index.html). Both can contribute to my learning phase of the art of war using Serenity.
