# Why I choose Rust?

Rust is the most loved programming language. If you compare different languages, Rust comes first. But it hasn't matured enough. But since the language is most loved, I could predict that it could be growing faster.

## WASM Support
Also WASM, Rust has good support for WASM. I think that's where the Rust ecosystem is moving towards. I am not really sure, just my observations, by skimming through different dev communities.

## Can you even prototype, bro?
Then Rust has a problem, it won't compile if the program is not implemented properly. Which makes it harder to prototype faster. Which is good if you think about it. It makes you write better programs. And you will really think like a true programmer. Isn't that what we want.

## ðŸ¤© BLOCKCHAIN ðŸ¤©
Also I really want to try using the Substrate framework. It is a framework written in Rust, to build your own custom blockchains. We all know how hyped the blockchain, crypto, web3 industry is. And since Rust is good at handling memory, I think the Metaverse would probably be mainly built using Rust.

## Dude, grow up!
But right now most libraries and frameworks are really young. How I know that? Well for one thing, most libraries and frameworks are still not even v1. V1 is mostly considered the initial stable version, fit for production use.
