# Remove console.logs in Production Code

## Do you use console.logs in production? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜± 

**DON'T, it's a bad practice!** Even if you comment them out, for easier debugging, it shows the developer is not confident about the source code, also it reveals TOO MUCH information about your code.

## So, what can we do? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

I found an article that suggests different ways to overcome this. ðŸ¤©

The following ways were suggested:
1. Use ES-Lint 'no-console', which reminds you to remove console.logs in your code
2. Use VS Code's log points

## Okay, but what are log points in VS Code. They were a new concept for me, maybe you too. ðŸ«£ðŸ«£

Found a blog from VS Code explaining about Logpoints (doesn't pause code), and also auto-attach (pauses code) feature for debugging ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
