# Normalize the use of Inclusive Language

Not many people think about this but aren't we always dealing with some type of communication medium.
We have to consider that the communication technology - language; is a powerful resource.

Using different words and sentences invoke different types of emotions in humans.

These patterns are increasing day-by-day. And with AI the patterns get shoved onto our face.

I remember in the humane tech forum, a proposal was made to IETF (International Engineering Task Force). It was about changing the use of "Dark Patterns" to "Deceptive Patterns". But later the use of inclusive language was more accepted standard.
